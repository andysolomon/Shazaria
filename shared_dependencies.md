The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the application. It is referenced by npm or yarn to manage the project's dependencies.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for the TypeScript compiler. It is used in all the .tsx files.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is used to initialize pages. It has shared dependencies with all the pages in the application.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is used to augment the application's html and body tags. It has shared dependencies with all the pages in the application.

8. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are used across all the pages in the application.

9. **favicon.ico**: This file is used in the _document.tsx file to set the favicon for the application.

10. **.gitignore**: This file is used to specify the files and folders that should be ignored by Git. It doesn't have shared dependencies with other files but is crucial for the project's version control.

11. **README.md**: This file is used to provide information about the project. It doesn't have shared dependencies with other files but is important for documentation.

Please note that the specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the application and are not known at this stage.
